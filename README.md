# PAM – Procedural Algorithm Maze (3D FPS)

A first-person 3D game developed with Unity, focused on procedural generation, shader experimentation, and immersive audio design.

Originally started as an algorithm-focused graduation project, the game evolved into a technical showcase demonstrating multiple areas of game development including real-time maze generation, custom shaders, and original soundtrack production.
