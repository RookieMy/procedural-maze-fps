# PAM – Procedural Algorithm Maze (3D FPS)

## ⚠️ Solo Developed  
## 🚨 Technical Showcase Project

A first-person 3D game built with Unity to demonstrate advanced technical capabilities in procedural generation, real-time rendering, and gameplay systems.

Originally started as an algorithm-focused graduation project, PAM evolved into a full technical showcase exploring multiple disciplines of game development including runtime maze generation, shader experimentation, and original soundtrack production.
